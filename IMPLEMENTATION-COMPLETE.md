# ✅ Implementation Complete: Queuescreen Player Type Selection

## 🎯 What Was Requested

Add an option during the queuescreen setup process to choose between:
1. **OMX Player** - Traditional overlay player with manual positioning
2. **Live TV2** - HTML5 embedded player (no OMX overlay)

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### ✨ Core Features

1. **✅ Setup Process Modified**
   - Added player type selection question during `php bin/setup.php`
   - Choice stored in `config.json` as `player_type`
   - Default is "omx" for backward compatibility

2. **✅ Live TV2 Player System Created**
   - Complete HTML5 player using HLS.js
   - Stream URL extraction and caching
   - Automatic URL refresh mechanism
   - No OMX overlay - fully embedded in webpage

3. **✅ Smart Routing System**
   - Single endpoint `omxplayer-loop.php` routes to correct player
   - Based on config, automatically chooses OMX or Live TV2
   - Backward compatible with existing OMX setups

4. **✅ Helper Scripts**
   - Linux/Pi: `extract-tv2-url.sh`
   - Windows: `extract-tv2-url.bat`
   - Both extract and cache RTM TV2 stream URLs

5. **✅ Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Complete setup guide
   - Integration examples
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Quick reference

## 🚀 How to Use

### For OMX Player (Existing Behavior)
```bash
# During setup
php bin/setup.php
> Select option [1] OMX Player

# Done! Works exactly as before
```

### For Live TV2 Player (New Feature)
```bash
# During setup
php bin/setup.php
> Select option [2] Live TV2

# Install yt-dlp
pip3 install yt-dlp

# Extract stream URL
sh bin/extract-tv2-url.sh

# Test
chromium-browser http://localhost/.../www/dev/tv2-player.html
```

### Switching Between Players
```bash
# Edit config.json
nano config.json

# Change to:
{
    "player_type": "live-tv2"  # or "omx"
}

# Restart
sudo reboot
```

## 🎬 Key Differences

### OMX Player
- ✅ Hardware accelerated (low CPU)
- ✅ Works offline with local files
- ❌ Overlaps webpage (manual positioning)
- ❌ Cannot interact with page underneath

### Live TV2 Player
- ✅ Embedded in webpage (no overlay)
- ✅ Responsive layout support
- ✅ Natural HTML/CSS integration
- ⚠️ Higher CPU usage
- ⚠️ Requires internet connection

## 📝 Notes

### Important Points
1. **OMX is default** - Backward compatible
2. **Live TV2 requires setup** - Need to extract URL
3. **Single endpoint** - omxplayer-loop.php routes both
4. **Config-driven** - Easy to switch
5. **Both directories updated** - Main and -rtm2

### Known Limitations
1. Live TV2 uses more CPU (software decoding)
2. Live TV2 requires internet connection
3. Stream URLs may expire (auto-refresh handles this)

### Future Enhancements
1. Add more player types
2. GUI for player switching
3. Multiple stream sources
4. Quality selection

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

All requested features have been implemented:
- ✅ Setup process includes player selection

- ✅ Live TV2 uses HTML5 (no OMX overlay)
- ✅ Dimensions/positioning noted in docs
- ✅ Both directories updated
- ✅ Complete documentation provided
- ✅ Tested and verified

## 🎯 Summary
