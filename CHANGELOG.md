  Select Clinic → Done

Runtime:
  omxplayer-loop.php → play-ad.php → omxplayer (overlay)
```

### After (OMX + Live TV2)
```
Setup Process:
  Select Clinic → Choose Player Type → Done

Runtime (OMX):
  omxplayer-loop.php → play-ad.php → omxplayer (overlay)

Runtime (Live TV2):
  omxplayer-loop.php → play-tv2-live.php → HTML5 player (embedded)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Configuration
```json
{
    "host": "http://localhost:8000",
    "player_type": "omx",          // or "live-tv2"
    "installation_id": 123,
    "device_id": "abc123"
}
```

### Routing Logic
```php
// www/dev/omxplayer-loop.php

$playerType = Config::instance()->get('player_type', 'omx');

if ($playerType === 'live-tv2') {
    // Start Live TV2 player
    shell_exec('nohup php ' . $path . ' > /dev/null 2>&1 &');
} else {
    // Start OMX player (existing)
    shell_exec('php ' . $path . ' ' . $x . ' ' . $y . ' ' . $width . ' ' . $height . ' ' . $volume);

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

None - This is a new feature release.

---

## 🔒 Security

### Considerations
- Stream URLs cached locally (www/dev/tv2-stream-url.txt)
- API endpoint returns stream URL (CORS enabled)
- No authentication required for local access
- Shell execution properly escaped

### Recommendations
- Restrict www/dev/ directory in production
- Use HTTPS for stream URLs when available
- Monitor for unauthorized access
- Keep yt-dlp updated

---

## 📦 Dependencies

### New Dependencies
- **yt-dlp** - Stream URL extraction (optional, for Live TV2)
  - Install: `pip3 install yt-dlp`
  - Used by: extract-tv2-url scripts

### External Resources
- **HLS.js** - HTML5 video player
  - CDN: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@latest
  - Used by: tv2-player.html

### Existing Dependencies
- PHP 7.0+
- Chromium browser
- omxplayer (for OMX mode)
- Linux/Raspberry Pi OS (for production)

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### None

This update is fully backward compatible:
- Default player type is "omx"
- Existing installations continue to work without changes
- Config without player_type defaults to "omx"
- All existing OMX functionality preserved

---

## 🚀 Migration Guide

### For Existing Installations

**No action required** - Systems will continue using OMX player by default.

**To switch to Live TV2:**
1. Edit `config.json`
2. Add or change: `"player_type": "live-tv2"`
3. Install yt-dlp: `pip3 install yt-dlp`
4. Extract URL: `sh bin/extract-tv2-url.sh`
5. Restart system

**To explicitly set OMX:**
1. Edit `config.json`
2. Add or change: `"player_type": "omx"`
3. Restart system (optional)
