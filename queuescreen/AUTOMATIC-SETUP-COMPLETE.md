# ✨ Automatic Live TV2 Setup - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented **fully automatic** dependency installation and setup for Live TV2 player during the queuescreen setup process.

---

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### Core Enhancement

When a user selects **"Live TV2"** during the setup process, the system now automatically:

1. ✅ **Checks for yt-dlp** - Verifies if yt-dlp is already installed
2. ✅ **Installs yt-dlp** - Automatically installs using pip3 (with sudo fallback if needed)
3. ✅ **Extracts Stream URL** - Runs the extraction script to get RTM TV2 stream URL
4. ✅ **Caches URL** - Saves the URL for the HTML5 player to use
5. ✅ **Validates Setup** - Confirms successful installation and extraction
6. ✅ **Restarts System** - Automatically reboots after 5 seconds to show the stream

### User Experience

**Before:**
```bash
php bin/setup.php
> Choose Live TV2
> Setup complete

# Manual steps required:
pip3 install yt-dlp
sh bin/extract-tv2-url.sh
sudo reboot
```

**After:**
```bash
php bin/setup.php
> Choose Live TV2
===========================================
Setting up Live TV2 dependencies...
===========================================

Step 1: Checking for yt-dlp...
  yt-dlp not found. Installing...
  Running: pip3 install yt-dlp
  ✅ yt-dlp installed successfully

Step 2: Extracting RTM TV2 stream URL...
  This may take a moment...
  ✅ Stream URL extracted successfully
  URL: https://stream.example.com/...

✅ Live TV2 setup complete!

The system will now restart to show the TV2 stream.
Rebooting in 5 seconds...
```

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `sources/src/Commands/SetupScreenCommand.php`

#### Added Automatic Setup Logic
```php
// After player type selection and envSetup()
if ($playerType === 'live-tv2' && strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0, 3)) !== 'WIN') {
    $output->writeln('Setting up Live TV2 dependencies...');
    
    if (!$this->setupLiveTV2Dependencies($output)) {
        // Show fallback instructions
        $output->writeln('Warning: Failed to complete Live TV2 setup...');
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Auto-restart
    sleep(5);
    shell_exec('sudo reboot');
}
```

#### Added New Method: `setupLiveTV2Dependencies()`

**Purpose:** Handles automatic installation and validation

**Steps:**
1. Check if yt-dlp is installed (`command -v yt-dlp`)
2. If not found, install with `pip3 install yt-dlp`
3. Try with sudo if first attempt fails
4. Verify installation
5. Make extraction script executable
6. Run extraction script
7. Validate URL was extracted successfully
8. Return true/false based on success

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful fallback to manual instructions
- Clear error messages at each step
- Validation of script existence and URL extraction

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Installation Process

**yt-dlp Installation:**
```bash
# Try without sudo first
pip3 install yt-dlp

# If fails, try with sudo
sudo pip3 install yt-dlp
```

**URL Extraction:**
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x bin/extract-tv2-url.sh

# Run extraction
sh bin/extract-tv2-url.sh
```

**Validation:**
- Checks if `www/dev/tv2-stream-url.txt` exists
- Verifies file size is at least 10 bytes
- Displays first 60 characters of extracted URL

**System Restart:**
```bash
# 5-second countdown
sleep(5)

# Reboot
sudo reboot
```

### Platform Support

- ✅ **Linux/Raspberry Pi** - Full automatic setup
- ⚠️ **Windows** - Skips automatic setup (development environment)

The Windows check prevents automatic setup on development machines:
```php
if ($playerType === 'live-tv2' && strtoupper(substr(PHP_OS, 0, 3)) !== 'WIN')
```
