## 🎬 **Quick Test Commands**

### Windows (Now)
```bash
# Test with PHP
php play-stream.php 0 0 1280 720

# Or just open test-player.html in browser
```

### Raspberry Pi (Later)
```bash
# Quick test

## 🔄 **If URL Stops Working**

Don't worry! Just re-extract:

1. Open `extract-guide.html`
2. Follow the same steps (takes 2 minutes)
3. Update `stream-url.txt` with new URL
4. Update `play-stream.sh` if needed

CloudFront URLs are usually very stable, so this shouldn't happen often!

## ✅ **Checklist**

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Stream tested on Windows (VLC or browser)
- [ ] Video plays smoothly, no buffering
- [ ] Audio and video in sync
- [ ] Read `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Chosen integration method (replace ads / scheduled / TV only)
