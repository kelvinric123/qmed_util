## 🚀 How to Use (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Extract the Stream URL

Since yt-dlp doesn't support RTM Klik, extract manually:

**📖 Open this guide (already opened in your browser):**
```
http://localhost/qmed-util/qmed-utils/queuescreen/test/extract-guide.html
```

**Quick steps:**
1. Open https://rtmklik.rtm.gov.my/live/tv2
2. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
3. Network tab → Filter: `m3u8`
4. Reload page (F5)
5. Find and copy the .m3u8 URL

**Example URL you'll find:**
```
https://rtm-live.glueapi.io/smil:rtm2/playlist.m3u8
```

---

### Step 2: Test the URL

**Open the test player (already opened):**
```
http://localhost/qmed-util/qmed-utils/queuescreen/test/test-player.html
```

1. Paste the URL you extracted
2. Click "Play Stream"
3. Enjoy ad-free RTM TV2! 🎉

---

### Step 3: Deploy to Raspberry Pi

Once tested on Windows, deploy to your queuescreen:

```bash
# 1. Copy test folder to Pi
scp -r test/ pi@your-pi-ip:~/qmed-utils/queuescreen/

# 2. On the Pi, edit play-stream.sh (line 55)
nano ~/qmed-utils/queuescreen/test/play-stream.sh

# Add your extracted URL:
STREAM_URL="paste_your_m3u8_url_here"

# 3. Test it
php ~/qmed-utils/queuescreen/test/play-stream.php 0 0 1920 1080

# 4. Integration with queuescreen (optional)
# Edit bin/cron.php to schedule TV streaming during specific hours
```

## 🎓 What You Learned

1. **X-Frame-Options blocks iframe embedding** - This is security, not a bug
2. **Direct stream URLs bypass restrictions** - Cleaner and faster
3. **HLS (.m3u8) is the streaming format** - Used by most live TV
4. **Browser DevTools are powerful** - Can extract almost anything
5. **yt-dlp doesn't support everything** - Manual extraction works!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Cache the URL
```bash
# Save extracted URL to file
echo "YOUR_URL" > test/stream-url.txt

# Then click "Load from Cache" in test-player.html
```

### Test with VLC (Alternative)
```bash
# Windows
vlc "YOUR_STREAM_URL"

# Or: File → Open Network Stream
```

### Auto-refresh URL (Raspberry Pi)
```bash
# URLs may expire, set up daily refresh
# Add to crontab:
0 3 * * * /path/to/extract-and-save-url.sh
```

## 🔄 What If URL Changes?

Stream URLs may expire or change when RTM updates their system.

**Solution:**
1. Re-extract using the guide
2. Update stream-url.txt
3. Or write a custom scraper for RTM

**Consider:**
- Setting up monitoring to detect when stream fails
- Auto-extracting when failure detected
- Having backup URLs

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Can't find .m3u8 URL?
- Try the JavaScript console method in extract-guide.html
- Look for any `.m3u8` or `playlist` files
- Check if video is actually playing (some regions may be blocked)

### Stream won't play?
- Test URL in VLC first
- Check if URL has expired
- Verify internet connection
- Try re-extracting the URL

### Want automated extraction?
- Consider writing a custom scraper for RTM
- Use Puppeteer/Playwright for browser automation
- Contact RTM for official API access
